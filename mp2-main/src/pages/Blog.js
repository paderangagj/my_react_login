                            <h3>What does Necessity is the mother of invention mean?</h3>

                            Before we look at the definition of the phrase as a whole, let's first explore the meaning of the individual words it contains. <br/>

                            The definition of necessity: something that is necessary, or absolutely needed/required

                            The definition of mother: in this case, the source or origin of something 

                            The definition of invention: a product of the imagination; something produced by ingenious thought, and by study and experiment

                            Looking at these three definitions clearly laid out, we can piece them together to arrive at the basic meaning of the phrase: When it's absolutely essential that something be done, the urgency will cause you—motivate you, even force you—to think of a way to do it.

                            Because moments of necessity are often problematic and precarious, this proverbial expression is also used to mean that difficult situations can lead to new and inspired approaches; that some of the most creative solutions are developed in response to hardships that need to be overcome. Given this, people sometimes change the expression to adversity is the mother of invention. You may also hear or see it as necessity is the mother of all invention. 

                            If you think about some of the biggest inventions of the not-too-distant past, the phrase certainly makes sense. But you don't even have to look to the past at all to see evidence of its wisdom: From the time the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading around the world, there became an incredibly urgent and immediate need for the creation of a vaccine to stop it. And indeed, at the time of this writing, scientists have, through ingenious thought and study and experiment, appeared to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine for the very first time.

                            <p>The Origin of the Expression, as is often the case with the common phrases discussed here at The Word Counter, no one is entirely certain of the, ahem, “mother” of this proverb. It is sometimes attributed to the Greek philosopher Plato, but that seems to be a mis attribution thanks to popular translations of his work The Republic. It doesn't appear Plato said the phrase exactly, though he most likely shared the sentiment. In the late 1880s, the translator Benjamin Jowett translated Plato’s Republic, interpreting his words once as simply “our need will be the real creator” and another time a bit more flowery, as “the true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention,” the reason why Plato is often credited with the saying.</p>
